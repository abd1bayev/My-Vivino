# Welcome to My Vivino
***

## Task
My Vivino is an online marketplace. We have a vast wine database, and we have 27 million users, mainly in North America.

One of our leading services is a wine recommendation system. It starts to be a little old. Rules-based. We are selling wine based on our customer visit/research.

You've just finished a meeting with your product manager. Data science is the future, and our competitor my_wine.com has invested a lot in it.

Following your suggestion, my_vivino's CEO has decided to allocate a budget to move forward on the data science project you've proposed.

It's an open project. You are free to find something you find will be useful to do some data analysis on:

rating system?
comments system? detect most valuable comments?
wine suggestion?
wine classification?
wine quality?
size of the market analysis?
suggestion base on a meal recipe?

## Description
Which project?

What are the success criteria?

During our next meeting, you will have to show us some data (plot? report?) of what you've been building.
Impact on the business. We need to make our customers happy.
What to expect?

Slides presentation.
And the DevOps team should be able to push it to production.
You've heard the CEO will be joining the meeting. It's a reminder if you do well, you can quickly expect the promotion you are expecting.
